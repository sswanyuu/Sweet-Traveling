# 🌍 Sweet-Traveling - A Beautiful Travel Companion

An elegant all-in-one travel application designed with SASS, featuring a stunning UI, smooth animations, and a well-structured layout. Inspired by my passion for travel, I built this project following Jonas Schmedtmann's guidance to create an immersive and user-friendly experience.

### ✨ Key Features:

✅ Modern & Responsive Design – Styled with SASS for a sleek and cohesive look.

✅ Flexbox Layout – Ensures a well-structured, adaptable, and visually appealing arrangement of elements.

✅ Smooth Animations – Enhances user interaction and engagement.

✅ Optimized for Travel Lovers – Aesthetic and intuitive design to make trip planning effortless.


This project showcases my frontend development skills, particularly in CSS architecture, UI/UX design, and animation techniques.
